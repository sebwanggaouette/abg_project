Some GIS analyses performed for the paper use hand-edited versions of 30m NASADEM rasters that were altered by the author to more closely align with topography described in historical maps. Those edited DEMs are available in this repository, for purposes of reproducability. All other GIS data used in the study are publically available elsewhere.
